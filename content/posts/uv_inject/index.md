Have you ever used `pipx inject`? It is the command to install a package into an existing pipx-managed virtual environment[^1].

### Pipx inject

Let's say you have installed the IPython interactive shell via `pipx install ipython` but
now you want to use `pandas` to do some data wrangling.

```bash
$ ipython
In [1]: import pandas as pd

```

![importing pandas returns ModuleNotFoundError](module_not_found.png)

To fix this, let's install `pandas` into the `ipython` environment:

```sh
pipx inject ipython pandas
```

Now we are good to go!

### But I use uv now...

If you mainly use `uv` and using `uv tool` to manage your Python app, you might have noticed
that `uv tool inject` does not exist.

So how can we "inject" a package into an app installed via uv? You need to add your additional
dependencies during the install command via `--with [package]`[^2]:

```sh
uv tool install --with pandas ipython
```

Et voil√†!
