Hi, my name is Rafael. I am a **software engineer** and programming enthusiast based in
Salzburg, Austria with experience in **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **DevOps**.

I enjoy automating processes and I'm trying to learn new things every day.

Besides that, I love sport climbing and tinkering on open-source projects.
